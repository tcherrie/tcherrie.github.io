Today, I gave a mini-conference at the "[Fête de la Science 2025](https://www.fetedelascience.fr/)" at ENS Paris-Saclay on the topological optimization of electric motors, a popularization event. It's always a pleasure to present my research to the general public! Thanks to Adrien Voldoire for the photo.
