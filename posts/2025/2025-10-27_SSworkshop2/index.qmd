Together with [Peter Gangl](https://people.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/p.gangl/home.htm), I am organizing a workshop entitled "[Advanced Techniques for Design Optimization in Engineering Applications](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/specsem/specsem2025/workshop2/)"". Many experts have confirmed their venues!

Registration is free but mandatory; check out the program!

This workshop is part of the [RICAM 2025 Special Semester](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/specsem/specsem2025/) "Computational Methods for Electrical Machines."
