Last week I had the chance to visit the [GRUCAD](https://grucad.ufsc.br/) institute, part of the [*Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina*](https://ufsc.br/) located on the beautiful island of Florian√≥polis, Brazil, as part of the OPTIMAT3D project supported by CAPES-COFECUB (grant number Ph1079/25). Together with Pr. Laurent Bernard, we worked on the topology optimization of a nonlinear inductor.
