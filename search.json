I teach electrical engineering, and my main research focuses on the topology optimization of electrical machines.\nI hold a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Université Paris-Saclay (ENS Paris-Saclay), where I worked at the SATIE. My PhD thesis can be found here (in French). Then, I did a postdoctoral stay at RICAM, where I was associated member of the CREATOR research consortium.\n\n\n\nCSMA 2024, Giens\n\n\n\n\n\nPhD Thesis, p. 227"
